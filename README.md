# pizza sales project 

**Project Summary:** 

This project aimed to analyze pizza sales performance to uncover key business insights using SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI. The process involved extracting, cleaning, and analyzing sales data to evaluate revenue trends, product performance, and customer purchase behavior.

Using SQL, essential KPIs such as total revenue, total pizzas sold, average order value, and best/worst-selling pizzas were derived. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to identify sales patterns by date, category, and size. In Excel, pivot tables and charts were created to summarize category-wise and monthly sales, while Power BI dashboards visualized KPIs and performance insights interactively.

**KPIS**

**Total Revenue:** ₹8,17,860

**Total Orders:** 21,350

**Total Pizzas Sold:** 49,574

**Average Order Value:** ₹38.31

. In **SQL,** created and queried the pizza_sales database to calculate total revenue (₹8.17L), average order value (₹38.31), total pizzas sold (49,574), and total orders (21,350). Identified top and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders, and analyzed daily and monthly sales trends.

In **Python (EDA)**, cleaned and visualized sales data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to reveal that Friday and Saturday evenings had the highest orders, July and January were the peak months, and Large pizzas generated the most revenue.

In **Power BI,** developed an interactive dashboard with DAX measures to monitor KPIs, visualize top/bottom sellers, sales trends, and category/size-wise performance.

In **Excel,** created a dynamic dashboard using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts to display key metrics, trends, and product performance.

**Key Insights:**

Classic pizzas contributed the highest sales and orders.

Large-size pizzas generated the maximum revenue share (~46%).

The Thai Chicken Pizza was the top seller by revenue, while the Brief Carre Pizza was the lowest performer.
